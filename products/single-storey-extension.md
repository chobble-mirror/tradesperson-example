A single-story extension is the perfect way to add valuable space to your home. Our expert team handles the entire process from initial design through to the final finishing touches, creating a seamless addition to your property.

Our extensions are built to the highest standards using quality materials that complement your existing home's appearance. Whether you're looking to expand your kitchen, add a dining room, or create a new living space, we'll work with you to design the ideal solution.

The process begins with a free consultation to understand your needs, followed by architectural drawings and planning applications. Our experienced builders then construct your extension with minimal disruption to your daily life.
