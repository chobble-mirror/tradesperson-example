## Popular Eco-Friendly Building Options

### Insulation Upgrades
We're seeing increased demand for natural insulation materials like sheep's wool, recycled denim, and cellulose (made from recycled paper). These materials not only have a lower environmental impact than traditional fiberglass insulation but also offer excellent thermal and acoustic properties.

### Reclaimed Materials
Using reclaimed timber for flooring, beams, and other structural elements adds character while reducing the demand for new resources. We work with local suppliers to source quality reclaimed materials for renovation projects.

### Energy-Efficient Windows and Doors
Modern double and triple-glazed windows and well-insulated doors can dramatically reduce heat loss. We install A-rated windows that exceed current energy efficiency standards.

### Water-Saving Fixtures
Low-flow toilets, aerated taps, and water-efficient showerheads can reduce household water consumption by up to 30% without compromising performance.
