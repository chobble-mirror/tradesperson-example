As temperatures drop across Manchester, now is the perfect time to prepare your home for winter weather. Our team has compiled this essential winter maintenance checklist to help protect your property from cold-weather damage.

> "Many of the expensive repairs we see in spring could have been prevented with some simple winter maintenance. A few hours of prevention can save homeowners thousands in potential damage." - Joe Example

## Winter Home Maintenance Checklist

### 1. Check Your Roof and Gutters

Inspect your roof for loose or damaged tiles that could allow water ingress during heavy rain or snow. Clear gutters and downpipes of autumn leaves and debris to prevent blockages that can lead to water damage.

### 2. Insulate Exposed Pipes

Frozen pipes can burst and cause significant damage. Insulate any exposed pipes in attics, basements, or external walls with proper pipe insulation sleeves.

### 3. Seal Drafts

Check windows and doors for drafts and apply weatherstripping where needed. Draft excluders on external doors can significantly reduce heat loss and lower your heating bills.

### 4. Service Your Heating System

Have your boiler serviced by a Gas Safe registered engineer to ensure it's operating safely and efficiently before the coldest weather arrives.
