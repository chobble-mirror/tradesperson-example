We're delighted to announce the launch of our new apprenticeship program, designed to provide training and career opportunities for young people interested in the building trades.

> "I started as an apprentice myself, and I know how valuable that hands-on experience can be. We want to help develop the next generation of skilled tradespeople in Manchester while addressing the industry-wide skills shortage." - Joe Example

## About Our Apprenticeship Program

Starting this September, we'll be taking on two apprentices who will work alongside our experienced team while completing their formal qualifications at a local college. The program will provide comprehensive training in various aspects of building work, from foundations and brickwork to finishing and decorating.

Apprentices will gain practical experience on real projects under careful supervision, developing the skills and knowledge needed for a successful career in construction. They'll also learn about building regulations, health and safety, and customer service - all essential elements of running a successful building business.

### Why We're Investing in Apprentices

The construction industry faces a significant skills shortage, with many experienced tradespeople approaching retirement age. By training the next generation, we're not only securing the future of our own business but also contributing to the wider industry.

We believe in the importance of passing on traditional building skills while also embracing modern methods and technologies. Our apprenticeship program combines time-honored craftsmanship with contemporary building practices to produce well-rounded, adaptable tradespeople.

If you know a young person who might be interested in our apprenticeship program, please encourage them to contact us for more information.
